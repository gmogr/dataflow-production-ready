# dataflow-production-ready
##Introduction
This repo aims to provide a reference implementation for Google Dataflow best practices around multiple topics through 
sample data pipelines. These samples don't focus on complex transformations or specific business logic, but rather the
on the scaffolding around data pipelines in terms of: 
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Infrastructure automation
* Deployment automation

The repo uses many concepts as explained in the Google Cloud blog series 
[Building production-ready data pipelines using Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/building-production-ready-data-pipelines-using-dataflow-overview)
